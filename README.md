Hello World - Docker Demo
=========================

This repository contains the code and configuration file for a **Hello World** example that defines three workflow operators for registration with an experimental version of the [drama workflow engine](https://github.com/heikomuller/drama/tree/feature/docker) that uses Docker to execute serial workflows.

Use the example script [install_and_run_from_github.py](https://github.com/heikomuller/drama/blob/feature/docker/examples/docker/install_and_run_from_github.py) to run a workflow containing all operators that are defined in this repository.
